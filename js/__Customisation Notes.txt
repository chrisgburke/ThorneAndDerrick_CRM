Documents
---------

Create a new entry in Custom_SysParams called 'RelativeDocPath' and store the UNC to the server doc share in here.
It should look something like \\Server\Library\  <-- with the trailing backslash!  That's important!

Customise Documents and add a new field called libr_copypath (Text, Caption = 'Copy', Exclude from quick find).

Edit LibraryList.  Add the libr_copypath field to the leftmost side (i.e. position 0).  Then add the following to Custom Content:

    <script src='../CustomPages/ClientSideCustomContent/Documents_LibraryList.js'></script>

This requires the following dependencies in js/custom:
                clipboard.min.js
                tooltipsy.min.js



Company / Person
----------------

Edit CompanyBoxLong and add this in Custom Content:

    <script src='../CustomPages/ClientSideCustomContent/Company_CompanyBoxLong.js'></script>


Edit PersonBoxLong and add this in Custom Content:

    <script src='../CustomPages/ClientSideCustomContent/Person_PersonBoxLong.js'></script>

Dependencies in js/custom:
                increaseCrmLib.js
                increaseFieldValidationHelper.js
                increaseDialogBoxHelper.js (actually, we probably don't need this...).


Opportunity
-----------

Create a new field on Users called 'user_teamcode' which will hold a single character - H, P or E.

The oppo_productgroup and oppo_manufacturer fields need to have multiple lookup familes defined called:

    oppo_productgroup_p
    oppo_productgroup_h
    oppo_productgroup_e

...and the same idea for oppo_manufacturer.  Each family holds the products/mfg codes relevant to the team.

Then edit OpportunityDetailBox and put the Create Scripts in.

Quote Items
-----------

For some reason the form works differently here than it does at marian doors; the form does not submit each time a Prod Family or Product is slected, so we have to
handle the SSA change.
